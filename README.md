# Youtube_Clone
A website to play youtube videos, it is built using React library and Youtube API.

To get the application running locally:

- Install Node JS. Refer to https://nodejs.org/en/ to install nodejs.

- Install create-react-app npm package globally. This will help to easily run the project and also build the source files easily. Use the following command to install create-react-app

```bash
         $ npm install -g create-react-app
```

- Clone the repo and using command line move in to the project folder

- Install all required dependencies.
```
         $ npm install
```

- Start the local server (this project uses [create-react-app](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html))

```
         $ npm start
```

Local web server will use port 3000. Port can be onfigured in scripts section of `package.json`.
